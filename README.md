# UnityPlayground
Welcome to **UnityPlayground**! This repository contains various Unity projects developed as part of a guided learning path into **game development with Unity and C#**.

> ðŸŽ® **Inspired by the [Unity and C# - The Ultimate Guide to Game Development by Andres Metz](https://www.udemy.com/course/cs-unity-beginner/?couponCode=MINICPCP70425)** on Udemy.  
The content here follows the structure of the course and is focused on mastering game scripting fundamentals using Unity and C#.

## Projects Overview

This repository includes different mini-projects and practice scenes created during the course, such as:

- âœ… Player movement and controls
- âœ… Collisions and physics
- âœ… Game mechanics: scoring, UI, power-ups
- âœ… Scene management and transitions
- âœ… Prefabs and object instantiation
- âœ… Scripting patterns and architecture
- âœ… Basic 2D/3D games (e.g., shooters, platformers, etc.)

Each Unity project or section is organized in its own folder and corresponds to parts of the course.
